**Dying Light 2: Stay Human** is an action role-playing survival horror game developed and published by Techland. It is the sequel to the 2015 game *Dying Light* and was released on February 4, 2022, for platforms including PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic open world overrun by zombies, with a focus on parkour, melee combat, and survival mechanics.

### Key Features:
1. **Open World**: The game takes place in the city of Villedor, a massive urban environment divided into distinct zones. Players can explore the city freely, using parkour to navigate rooftops, streets, and interiors.

2. **Parkour Movement**: The game emphasizes fluid and dynamic parkour mechanics, allowing players to climb, jump, and traverse the environment with ease. This is crucial for escaping zombies and reaching safe zones.

3. **Combat**: Melee combat is a core aspect of the game, with a variety of weapons, mods, and upgrades available. Players can craft and customize weapons to suit their playstyle. The game also introduces new combat mechanics, such as parrying and dodging.

4. **Day-Night Cycle**: Like its predecessor, *Dying Light 2* features a dynamic day-night cycle. During the day, zombies are slower and less aggressive, but at night, more dangerous and faster infected emerge, making exploration riskier but more rewarding.

5. **Choices and Consequences**: The game incorporates a branching narrative where player choices significantly impact the story, world, and relationships with factions. These decisions can alter the city's layout, alliances, and available resources.

6. **Factions**: Villedor is home to various factions, each with its own goals and ideologies. Players can align with different groups, affecting the game's outcome and the balance of power in the city.

7. **Co-op Multiplayer**: The game supports up to four players in cooperative multiplayer, allowing friends to explore the world, complete missions, and survive together.

8. **Graphics and Atmosphere**: *Dying Light 2* features improved visuals and a more immersive atmosphere, with detailed environments, dynamic weather, and a haunting soundtrack.

### Story:
The game is set 20 years after the events of the first *Dying Light*, in a world still struggling with the zombie virus. Players take on the role of Aiden Caldwell, a Pilgrim (a courier and explorer) who travels between settlements in search of his lost sister. Along the way, Aiden becomes entangled in the power struggles of Villedor's factions and must make difficult choices to survive and uncover the truth.

### Reception:
*Dying Light 2* received generally positive reviews for its improved parkour mechanics, expansive world, and engaging gameplay. However, some critics noted issues with the narrative pacing and technical bugs at launch. Despite this, the game has been well-received by fans of the series and the survival horror genre.
